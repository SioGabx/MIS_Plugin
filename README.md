Aditional commands that i have created for AutoCAD 2021

List of commands :

  - FORCELAYERCOLORTOENTITY : Force the layer color to the entity. Perfect sometimes when you want to put all entity to the layer 0, but you want to keep original colors

  - RNLAYEROFENTITY : Comming soon (Rename the name of the current entity layer)
